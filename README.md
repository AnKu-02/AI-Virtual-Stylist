# 👗 StyleMorph: AI-Powered Virtual Stylist 🎨

**StyleMorph** is a cutting-edge computer vision project that transforms how people interact with fashion. It uses deep learning to segment clothing from real-world photos, apply style transfer, and recommend similar outfits — all powered by AI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧍‍♀️ **Clothing Segmentation** – Isolate clothing from the person in an image using U²-Net.
- 🎨 **Style Transfer** – Apply artistic or fashion styles (e.g., streetwear, vintage) to outfits.
- 🧠 **Outfit Recommendation** – Suggest visually similar clothing using deep learning–based image similarity.
- 🌐 (Optional) **Interactive Web App** – Try it via a simple UI using Streamlit or Gradio.
